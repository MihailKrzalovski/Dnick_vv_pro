                <p style="line-height: 20px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">While the terms ‘data’ and ‘statistics’ are often used interchangeably, in scholarly research there is an important distinction between them. &nbsp;</p>

                <p style="line-height: 20px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">data are individual pieces of factual information recorded and used for the purpose of analysis. It is the raw information from which statistics are created.&nbsp;&nbsp; Statistics are the results of data analysis - its interpretation and presentation. In other words some computation has taken place that provides some understanding of what the data means. Statistics are often, though they don’t have to be, presented in the form of a table, chart, or graph.&nbsp;</p>

                <p style="line-height: 20px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Both statistics and data are frequently used in scholarly research. Statistics are often reported by government agencies - for example, unemployment statistics or educational literacy statistics. Often these types of statistics are referred to as 'statistical data'.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p style="line-height: 20px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;">Using the Twin Cities Light Rail Transit Green Line as an example, let's briefly explore the difference between data and statistics.<br>
                            &nbsp;</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;</p>

                        <p style="line-height: 20px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"><strong>FROM DATA...</strong><br>
                            The Metro Transit Commission (MTC) provides raw data files for many of their operations. This information is made available in a machine-readable format so it is easily usable with statistical analysis software.</p>

                        <p style="line-height: 20px; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"><br>
                            <strong>...TO STATISTICS</strong><br>
                            This raw data was used to create a graph showing average daily boardings by month on the Green Line train in a news story by the <a href="https://www.startribune.com/" target="blank"><em>Star Tribune</em></a> published online on July 27, 2015. This statistical information allowed readers to better understand the raw data. Remember, statistics are created once data are analyzed and computations are done. Statistics are often (although not always) presented in the form of a table, chart, or graph. In this case, the <em>Star Tribune</em> reporter used the graph to show the average number of riders who boarded the LRT at each of the various stations along the Green Line during each month of 2014. The raw MTC data counting the numbers of riders who boarded at each stop on each day was used to determine an average number of riders boarding at each station during each month.</p>
