<h3>The definiton of unit </h3>
<p>In maths, a unit can be defined as the place of one or the rightmost number. The basic units that are utilised for measurement are also defined as units. The non-mathematical definition says that the unit is the individual person or item which is considered complete; however, it is also a part of the community or the whole.

    The unit of measurement, for instance, is the definite magnitude of quantity which is used as the norm for measurement of the same form of quantity, adopted and specified by the law or convention. You can express some other quantity of that type as the multiple of the measuring unit. The measurement unit is the standard quantity of the physical property which is used as the factor for expressing the quantity of that specific property that exists.</p>
<h3>The Different Systems of Measurement</h3>
<p>The unit system tends to vary for different countries. Some of the different types of units that are prevalent today include the FPS system of units, the CGS system of units, the SI system of units, and the MKS system of units. The major systems for measurement that are commonly used today are the Imperial system, the Metric system, and Natural systems. We will have a brief look at these different systems.<br>


    <strong>Imperial System:</strong> The imperial unit, also called the British imperial system is the standard or default system for weights and measures. This was officially used in Britain from 1824 until the metric system was launched in 1965.<br>


    <strong>Metric System:</strong> The metric system is the international system of units which is the latest and the international standard system. This system is denoted by  SI. Standardising is one of the important aspects of modern systems. Every unit has a widely known size.<br>

    <strong>Natural System:</strong> The natural units are the physical units for measurement that are based only on the physical constants which are common. The elementary charge e is the natural unit for the electric charge, and the light speed c is the natural unit for velocity.</p>
