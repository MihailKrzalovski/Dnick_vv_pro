<h2>What are even and odd numbers?</h2>
<p><strong>Even numbers</strong> are divisible by 2 without remainders. They end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. <strong>Odd numbers</strong> are not evenly divisible by 2 and end in 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9.</p>
<p>You can tell whether a number is odd or even regardless of how many digits it has by looking at the final digit. For example, the numbers 52 and 3,052 are both even because they end in 2. On the other hand, the numbers 61 and 2,429,129 are both odd because they end in 1 and 9.</p>
