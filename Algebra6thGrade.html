<h1>Linear Functions </h1>
<hr>
<p>The linear function is popular in economics. It is attractive because it is
    simple and easy to handle mathematically. It has many important applications.</p>
<p> Linear functions are those whose graph is a straight line.</p>
<p> A linear function has the following form</p>
<blockquote>
    <p> y = f(x) = a + bx</p>
</blockquote>
<p> A linear function has one independent variable and one dependent variable.
    The independent variable is x and the dependent variable is y.</p>
<p> a is the constant term or the y intercept. It is the value of the dependent
    variable when x = 0.</p>
<p> b is the coefficient of the independent variable. It is also known as the
    slope and gives the rate of change of the dependent variable.</p>
