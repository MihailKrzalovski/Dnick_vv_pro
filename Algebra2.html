</div>
<p>Algebra 2 is the advanced level of pre-algebra and Algebra 1. It introduces higher grades topics such as evaluating equations and inequalities, matrices, vectors, functions, quadratic equations, complex numbers, relations, <a href="https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/inverse-operations/">inverse operations</a>, and various other properties. In algebra 2, we will also be incorporating a bit of geometry and coordinate geometry along with calculus to calculate the area, <a href="https://www.cuemath.com/measurement/volume/">volume,</a> and perimeters of shapes using <a href="https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/algebraic-expression/">algebraic expressions</a> instead of numbers.</p>
<p>Algebra 2 or elementary algebra deals with long-form algebraic expressions such as ax + b = c, ax + by + c = 0, ax + by + cz + d = 0 and a general form of representation of a quadratic equation is ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0, and for a polynomial equation, it is ax<sup>n </sup>+ bx<sup>n-1</sup>+ cx<sup>n-2</sup>+ .....k = 0.</p>

</div>
<p>Algebra is divided into numerous topics to help for a detailed study. Algebra 2 is divided into approximately 13 chapters and each chapter is divided into several lessons. These 12 chapters in Algebra 2 are given as:</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 1: Linear Equations and Inequalities</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chapter 2: Functions</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chapter 3: Relations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chapter 4: Cartesian and Coordinate System</strong></p>
