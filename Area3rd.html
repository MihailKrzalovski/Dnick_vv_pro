<h2 id="0-definition">Definition</h2>
<p>Area is defined as the total space taken up by a flat (2-D) surface or shape of an object.</p>
<p>Take a pencil and draw a square on a piece of paper. It is a 2-D figure. The space the shape takes up on the paper is called its <strong>Area</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, imagine your square is made up of smaller unit squares. The area of a figure is counted as the number of unit squars required to cover the overall surface area of that particular 2-D shape. Square cms, square feet, square inches, square meters, etc., are some of the common units of area measurement.</p>
<p>To find out the area of the square figures drawn below, draw unit squares of 1-centimeter sides. Thus, the shape will be measured in <strong>cmÂ²</strong>, also known as square centimeters.</p>
