<h1>Derivatives</h1>
<p>A derivative in calculus is the rate of change of a quantity y with respect to another quantity x. It is also termed the differential coefficient of y with respect to x. Differentiation is the process of finding the derivative of a function.</p>
<p>Let us learn what exactly a derivative means in calculus and how to find it along with rules and examples.</p>

</div>
<p>The <strong>derivative</strong> of a <a href="https://www.cuemath.com/calculus/What-are-functions/">function</a> f(x) is usually represented by d/dx (f(x)) (or) df/dx (or) Df(x) (or) f'(x). Let us see what a derivative technically means. Consider a curve of function f(x) and let two points on it be (x, f(x)) and ((x + h), f(x + h)). Then the <a href="https://www.cuemath.com/geometry/slope/">slope</a> of the secant line through these points is given by [f(x + h) - f(x)]/(x + h - x) = [f(x + h) - f(x) / h. See the figure below and observe that when the distance between two points is closely equal to 0 (i.e., as h approaches 0), the second point overlaps the original point and the secant line becomes the <a href="https://www.cuemath.com/calculus/tangent-line/">tangent line</a>. In calculus, the slope of the tangent line is referred to as the derivative of the function. i.e.,</p>
<ul>
    <li>The derivative of the function, f '(x) = Slope of the tangent = lim<sub>hâ†’0 </sub>[f(x + h) - f(x) / h.</li>
</ul>

<p>This formula is popularly known as the "limit definition of the derivative" (or) "derivative by using the first principle".</p>
