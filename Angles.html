<h3 id="0-what-is-an-angle-"><strong>What is an angle?</strong></h3>
<p>An angle is the space between two intersecting lines where they join at a point. The size of the angle is measured in degrees.</p>

<p>Depending on the numerical range of ‘space’ between the sets of intersecting lines, the angles can be classified into different types of angles: acute, obtuse, reflex or right anges.</p>

<h4 id="2-what-is-a-right-angle-"><strong>What is a right angle?</strong></h4>
<p>A right angle is created when&nbsp; two intersecting lines meet at exactly 90 degrees. This is often regarded as a quarter turn as four quarter turns would result in a whole turn. A right angle is annotated between two intersecting lines through the use of a square.</p>

<h4 id="3-what-is-an-acute-angle-"><strong>What is an acute angle?</strong></h4>
<p>An acute angle is where the space between two intersecting lines range between 1 and 89 degrees.</p>

<h4 id="4-what-is-an-obtuse-angle-"><strong>What is an obtuse angle?</strong></h4>
<p>An obtuse angle is where the space between two intersecting lines ranges between 91 and 179 degrees.</p>
