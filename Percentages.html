<h1 class="pull-left">Introduction to Percentages %</h1>
<p class="lead">The term ‘per cent’ means ‘out of a hundred’. In mathematics, percentages are used like fractions and decimals, as ways to describe parts of a whole. &nbsp;When you are using percentages, the whole is considered to be made up of a hundred equal parts. The symbol % is used to show that a number is a percentage, and less commonly the abbreviation ‘pct’ may be used.</p>
<p class="first-para">You will see percentages almost everywhere: in shops, on the internet, in advertisements and in the media. Being able to understand what percentages mean is a key skill that will potentially save you time and money and will also make you more employable.</p>

<h2>The Meaning of Percentages</h2>
<p class="first-para">Percentage is a term from Latin, meaning ‘out of one hundred’.</p>
<p><strong>You can therefore consider each ‘whole’ as broken up into 100 equal parts, each one of which is a single percent.</strong></p>
