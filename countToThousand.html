<h2 id="section---WhatIsOneThousand">What is One Thousand?</h2>
<p>What would you do if you had one thousand dollars? You might want to buy things like a PS4 or an American Girl Doll. But do you know what one thousand dollars looks like? Would you know what the cashier owes you back in change if you paid with one thousand dollars? We need to take a look at counting whole numbers to one thousand and backwards from one thousand. </p>
<p><b>One thousand</b> is shown as 1,000. You would have to count one thousand whole numbers starting from zero and ending with one thousand, just like you would count ten whole numbers to count from zero to ten. A <b>whole number</b> is any number that is not a fraction or decimal. </p>
<p>For example: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 are the whole numbers from zero to ten. </p>
<p>You could count those whole numbers to ten really fast. I bet you could even count to one hundred as well. However, counting whole numbers to one thousand takes much more time. Can you think of any ways we can count to one thousand faster? </p>
