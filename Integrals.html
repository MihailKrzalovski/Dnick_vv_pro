<h1>Integral Calculus</h1>
<p>Integral calculus helps in finding&nbsp;the anti-derivatives of a function. These anti-derivatives are also called the integrals&nbsp;of the function.&nbsp;The process of finding the anti-derivative of a function is called integration. The inverse process of finding derivatives is finding the integrals. The integral of a function represents a family of curves. Finding both derivatives and integrals form the fundamental calculus. In this topic, we will cover the basics of integrals and evaluating integrals.</p>

<p>Integrals are the values of the function found by the process of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cuemath.com/calculus/integration/">integration.</a> The process of getting f(x) from f'(x) is called integration. Integrals assign&nbsp;numbers to functions in a way that describe&nbsp;displacement and motion problems, area and volume problems, and so on that arise by combining all the small data. Given the derivative f’ of the function f, we can determine the function f. Here, the function f is called antiderivative or integral of f’.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Example: Given: f(x) = x<sup>2 </sup>.</p>
<p>Derivative of f(x) = f'(x) = 2x = g(x)</p>
<p>if g(x) = 2x, then&nbsp;anti-derivative of g(x) = ∫ g(x) = x<sup>2&nbsp;</sup></p>
