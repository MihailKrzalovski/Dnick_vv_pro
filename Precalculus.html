<h3>Intro to Precalculus</h3>
<p>Precalculus is a course that is designed to prepare students for Calculus, either in high school or college. </p>
<p>Now, calculus is the study of how things change over time; therefore, the goal of precalculus is to equip students to handle rigorous and dynamic concepts by helping them to connect their previous learning from Algebra and Geometry.</p>
<p>To do this, Pre-Calculus is divided into two major categories: <b>Trigonometry and Math Analysis</b>.</p>
<h2 data-gtm-vis-has-fired-9294159_82="1">Trigonometry Course</h2>
<p>Trigonometry, which is the study of triangles, typically begins with an understanding of basic functions, then branches into how triangles and their angles can be drawn and represented in rotations, degrees and radian measure. </p>
<h2 data-gtm-vis-has-fired-9294159_82="1">Math Analysis Course</h2>
<p>Whereas Math Analysis, which some instructors sometimes call Algebra 3, digs deeper into algebra concepts. Specifically, functions, domain and range, and end behavior.</p>
<p>The focus of math analysis is not to just review or solve more complicated equations, but to show students how to represent them in various formats (i.e., graphically, numerically, and verbally). </p>
