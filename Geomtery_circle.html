<h1>Area of a Circle</h1>
<p>The area of a circle is the space occupied by the circle in a two-dimensional plane. Alternatively, the space occupied within the boundary/circumference of a circle is called the area of the circle. The formula for the area of a circle is A = πr<sup>2</sup>, where r is the radius of the circle. The unit of area is the square unit, for example, m<sup>2</sup>, cm<sup>2</sup>, in<sup>2</sup>, etc. <strong>Area of Circle = πr<sup>2</sup> or πd<sup>2</sup>/4 in square units, where <a href="https://www.cuemath.com/geometry/what-is-pi/">(Pi) π</a> = 22/7 or 3.14. </strong>Pi (π) is the ratio of circumference to diameter of any circle. It is a special mathematical constant.</p>
<p>The area of a circle formula is useful for measuring the region occupied by a circular field or a plot. Suppose, if you have a circular table, then the area formula will help us to know how much cloth is needed to cover it completely. The area formula will also help us to know the boundary length i.e., the circumference of the circle. Does a circle have volume? No, a circle doesn't have a volume. A circle is a <a href="https://www.cuemath.com/geometry/2d-shapes/">two-dimensional shape</a>, it does not have volume. A circle only has an area and perimeter/circumference. Let us learn in detail about the area of a circle, surface area, and its circumference with examples.</p>
<h3>Perimeter of Circle Formula</h3>
<p>Perimeter of a circle = 2 π r = π D units</p>
<p>where,</p>
<ul>
    <li>r = radius of the circle</li>
    <li>D = diameter of the circle.</li>
</ul>
