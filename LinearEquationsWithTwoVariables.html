<h1>Linear Equations in Two Variables</h1>
<p>A linear equation in two variables is an equation in which two variables have the exponent 1. A system of equations with two variables has a unique solution, no solutions, or infinitely many solutions. A linear system of equations may have 'n' number of variables. An important thing to keep in mind while solving linear equations with n number of variables is that there must be n equations to solve and determine the value of variables. The set of solutions obtained by solving these linear equations is a straight line. Linear equations in two variables are the algebraic equations which are of the form (or can be converted to the form) y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the <a href="https://www.cuemath.com/geometry/y-intercept/">y-intercept</a>. They are the equations of the first order. For example, y = 2x + 3 and 2y = 4x + 9 are two-variable linear equations.</p>

<p>The linear equations in two variables are the equations in which each of the two variables are of the highest <a href="https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/exponents/">exponent</a> order of 1 and have one, none, or infinitely many solutions. The standard form of a two-variable linear equation is ax + by + c = 0 where x and y are the two variables. The solutions can also be written in <a href="https://www.cuemath.com/geometry/ordered-pair/">ordered pairs</a> like (x, y). The graphical representation of the system of linear equations in two variables includes two straight lines which could be <a href="https://www.cuemath.com/geometry/intersecting-and-non-intersecting-lines/">intersecting lines</a>, parallel lines, or <a href="https://www.cuemath.com/geometry/coincident-lines/">coincident lines</a>.</p>
