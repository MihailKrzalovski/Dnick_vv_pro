<h3>What is division?</h3>
<p><strong>Division </strong>is splitting something equally. For instance, let's say you have <span class="equation">10</span> raffle tickets, and you'd like to share them with <span class="equation">5</span> friends.</p>
<div class="centerImage" style="width: 730px; margin-top: 0;" rel="width: 730; margin-top: 0;"><img loading="lazy" src="https://media.gcflearnfree.org/ctassets/topics/228/div_3_1_illustration_1EDIT.png" width="730" height="325"></div>
<p>You <strong>divide</strong> the tickets among your friends. Each friend gets an equal number of tickets.</p>

<p>See how they each have <span class="equation">2</span> tickets? When you divide 10 tickets among your five friends, you create <span class="equation">5</span> equal groups of <span class="equation">2 </span>tickets.</p>
<h4> Writing division expressions</h4>
<p>In the slideshow, you saw that we divided six cupcakes into two equal groups. To figure out the number of cupcakes that are in each group, you could write a <strong>division expression </strong>like this:</p>
<p class="probCentered"><span class="blue">6 / 2 </span></p>
<p>You could also write the expression like this:</p>
<p class="probCentered"><span class="blue">6 ÷ 2<br></span></p>
<p>You can read either expression as <strong>six divided by two</strong>. The <strong>division sign</strong> (<span class="equation"><span class="equation">/</span> </span>or<span class="equation"> <span class="equation">÷</span></span>) means something is being divided. This is why we always put it <strong>after</strong> the first number — there were<span class="equation"> 6</span> cupcakes, and we divided them into <span class="equation">2</span> groups.</p>
<p>Many real-life situations can be expressed with division. For example, imagine you're placing <span class="equation">15</span> cans on <span class="equation">3</span> shelves. You can divide to make sure you put the same number of cans on each shelf. In other words, 15 cans divided by three shelves, or <span class="equation">15 / 3</span>.</p>
