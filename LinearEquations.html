<p>A linear equation in one variable is of the form of ax+b=0, where a and b are any two <a href="https://www.cuemath.com/numbers/integers/">integers</a> and x is an unknown variable having only one solution. Let us understand this by taking an example- "4 added to a certain number gives 10". Find that number. How can we represent this problem in a simpler way? We can say, x + 4 = 10 , find x. We assigned a variable to that number; this is called an equation. It helps us write large problems like this in a shorter way. This equation has one variable which is x and the highest power of x is one. These kinds of equations are known as <strong>linear equations in one variable</strong> because the <a href="https://www.cuemath.com/algebra/degree-of-a-polynomial/">degree</a> of the variable x is one.</p>
