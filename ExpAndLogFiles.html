<h2>Exponential Functions</h2>
<p>The function f(x) = 2<sup>x</sup> is called an exponential function because the variable, x, is the exponent. In general, exponential functions are of the form f(x) = a<sup>x</sup>, where <em>a</em> is a positive constant. There are three kinds of exponential functions:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both the red and blue curves above are examples of exponential growth because their base is greater than 1. The green and purple curves are examples of exponential decay because their base is between 0 and 1. The yellow curve is a special case, and we won’t consider this further, since it can be classified as a linear model.</p>
<h2>Logarithmic Functions</h2>
<p>The inverse of an exponential function is called a logarithmic function. Therefore, the inverse of f(x) = a<sup>x</sup> is the logarithmic function with base a, such that y = log<sub>a&nbsp;</sub>x↔&nbsp;a<sup>y</sup> = x.</p>

<p>In the figure above, the red line represents an exponential function and the blue line represents its inverse, the logarithmic function. Since the exponential and logarithmic functions are inverse functions, cancellation laws apply to give:</p>
<p>log<sub>a</sub>(a<sup>x</sup>) = x for all real numbers x</p>
<p>a<sup>log</sup><sub>a</sub><sup>x</sup> = x for all x &gt; 0</p>
